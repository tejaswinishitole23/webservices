# JaxRS on Tomcat

Tomcat basic version does not support JaxRS out of the box.

Tomcat EE version does.

To make tomcat basic work with JaxRS you need to use other libraries.

This example uses RESTEasy.

**RESTEasy** is the JAX-RS implementation provided by JBoss project. It works with tomcat also.
